description: A Concept Explained
title: The Concept 
---
	<p>As mentioned On the homepage, this is simply a concept page of a possible app idea that a friend of mine, Tom Scallon had. While one day it would be great to begin developing an app such as this, for now I'll happily settle for the promotional landing page.</p> 
	<p>In truth, I wanted this to be a working concept to show how I would colour and handle the content for an application such this. Obviously as credited below, the design and framework of the page belongs to HTML5 UP, who have made the web a better place just by letting folks tailor their amazing templates.</p>
	<p>I hope you enjoyed the landing page, keep an eye on my website <a href="https://antvd.space">AntVD.space</a> for further projects like this,
	<br>Thanks,
	<br>Anthony</p>
